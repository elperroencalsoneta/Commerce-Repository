Collect a large dataset of webpages containing the elements you want to identify. You can do this by manually collecting webpages or by using web scraping techniques.

Preprocess the data by cleaning and formatting it in a way that is suitable for machine learning. This might include removing irrelevant or redundant information, creating numerical features, or creating a balanced dataset.

Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the AI model, and the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm and train it on the training set. This might involve selecting the type of algorithm, choosing hyperparameters, and optimizing the model using techniques such as cross-validation.

Evaluate the model on the test set and fine-tune it as needed. This might involve adjusting the hyperparameters, adding or removing features, or changing the type of algorithm.

Use the trained model to predict the presence or absence of the elements you want to identify in new webpages.
